Miscellaneous things to do.

Legend:

- E asy
- M edium
- H ard

- U Needed for basic usability.
- S Needed to support bayeslite databases and models long-term.
- Q Needed to support BQL queries long-term.
- * Not on the radar for alpha release.

- V ery consequential (within bayeslite)
- C onsequential
- I nconsequential

* BayesDB issues

[MUC] Subsampling analysis, post-analysis insertion.

* Compiler issues

[H*I] Figure out lexical scope of columns in queries.
  . Confirm column exists before running SQL so no accidental strings.
[H*I] Type-check queries.
[EUI] Fix name quotation when generating SQL code:
  . Omit needless double-quotes in sqlite3_quote_name.

* Python API issues

[M*C] Implement bayeslite cursors separately from sqlite cursors.
[EUC] Make all BQL phrases return proper cursors.
[EUI] Support some kind of progress notification for long queries.
  . Call progress notifier in each BQL function.
[H*V] Switch from the Python sqlite3 module to apsw.
[MUC] Formalize exceptions better.

* Schema issues

[M*I] Document schemas: crosscat model schema, bayeslite SQL schema.
[MUI] Pull diagnostics out of json and into the bayesdb_model table, or
  a metamodel-specific table, so we can do queries on them.
  . SELECT modelno FROM bayesdb_model
        WHERE table_id = 32 AND iterations < 10
  . Just iterations for now, not other diagnostics.
[MUC] Move column metadata into SQL tables so you can do queries on it.
  . ESTIMATE COLUMNS FROM foo WHERE modeltype = 'numerical'
[HSI] Automatic tests for schema upgrades.
[MUC] dha NAME column with codebook without models is all borked up.
  . Add column modelled_colno to bayesdb_table_column.
  . Adapt all modelling to use modelled_colno, not colno.

* Language issues

** Major design changes

[MQV] Split `btable' into `table' and `generator'.
[MQV] Generator schemas: CREATE GENERATOR t_cc FOR t USING crosscat(...)
[HQV] Make `COLUMNS OF generator' a first-class table in BQL.
[MQV] SELECT t.(ESTIMATE COLUMNS ...)
[MQC] Reject metamodel-specific functions in SELECT; use ESTIMATE instead.
[MQI] Provide a way to name models.
[MQI] SELECT c.name, SIMILARITY OF c TO s
      FROM city AS c, city AS s
      WHERE s.name = c.sister

** Minor tweaks

[M*I] Common table expressions (WITH t AS (SELECT ...); SELECT ...).
  (Requires upgrading sqlite3 past what's in Ubuntu 14.04.)
[MQI] Implement INFER to DTRT with imputing for predictive probability.
[H*C] Implement SIMULATE as a virtual table.
[MQI] Support renaming columns.

* Shell

[HUI] Background analysis in the bayeslite shell.
[MUI] Allow multiline queries/expressions in .sql/.python shell commands.
[HUI] Allow statements and expressions alike in .python command.
[MUI] Figure out how to write transactions command by command in shell.

** Plotting

[MUI] Get plotting in the bayeslite shell working in Ubuntu 14.04.
[MUI] Plotting on Mac OS X is all borked up.
[MUI] Plotting on Ubuntu 14.04 is all borked up.
