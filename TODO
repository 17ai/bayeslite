Legend:

- E asy
- M edium

- * Not on the radar for alpha release.

- V ery consequential (within bayeslite)
- C onsequential
- I nconsequential

* BayesDB issues

[MUC] Subsampling analysis.

* Compiler issues

[H*I] Figure out lexical scope of columns in queries.
  . Confirm column exists before running SQL so no accidental strings.
[H*I] Type-check queries.
[EUI] Fix name quotation when generating SQL code:
  . Omit needless double-quotes in sqlite3_quote_name.

* Python API issues

[M*C] Implement bayeslite cursors separately from sqlite cursors.
[EUC] Make all BQL phrases return proper cursors.
[EUI] Support some kind of progress notification for long queries.
  . Call progress notifier in each BQL function.
[H*V] Switch from the Python sqlite3 module to apsw.
[MUC] Formalize exceptions better.

* Schema issues

[M*I] Document schemas: crosscat model schema, bayeslite SQL schema.
[HSI] Automatic tests for schema upgrades.

* Language issues

** Major design changes

[HQV] Make `COLUMNS OF generator' a first-class table in BQL.
[MQV] SELECT t.(ESTIMATE COLUMNS ...)
[MQI] Provide a way to name models.
[MQI] SELECT c.name, SIMILARITY OF c TO s
      FROM city AS c, city AS s
      WHERE s.name = c.sister

** Minor tweaks

[M*I] Common table expressions (WITH t AS (SELECT ...); SELECT ...).
  (Requires upgrading sqlite3 past what's in Ubuntu 14.04.)
[MQI] Implement INFER to DTRT with imputing for predictive probability.
[H*C] Implement SIMULATE as a virtual table.
[MQI] Support renaming columns.
[EQC] INSERT in BQL.
[MQC] UPDATE in BQL.

* Shell

[HUI] Background analysis in the bayeslite shell.
[MUI] Allow multiline queries/expressions in .sql/.python shell commands.
[HUI] Allow statements and expressions alike in .python command.

** Plotting

[MUI] Get plotting in the bayeslite shell working in Ubuntu 14.04.
[MUI] Plotting on Mac OS X is all borked up.
[MUI] Plotting on Ubuntu 14.04 is all borked up.
