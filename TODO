Miscellaneous things to do:

* BayesDB issues

- Subsampling analysis, post-analysis insertion.

* Compiler issues

- Figure out lexical scope of columns in queries.
- Type-check queries.
- Fix name quotation when generating SQL code:
  . Omit needless double-quotes in sqlite3_quote_name.
  . Confirm column exists before running SQL so no accidental strings.

* Python API issues

- Implement bayeslite cursors separately from sqlite cursors.
- Make all BQL phrases return proper cursors.
- Support some kind of progress notification for long queries.
- Switch from the Python sqlite3 module to apsw.
- Formalize exceptions better.

* Schema issues

- Document schemas: crosscat model schema, bayeslite SQL schema.
- Pull diagnostics out of json and into the bayesdb_model table, or
  a metamodel-specific table, so we can do queries on them.
  . SELECT modelno FROM bayesdb_model
        WHERE table_id = 32 AND iterations < 10
- Move column metadata into SQL tables so you can do queries on it.
  . ESTIMATE COLUMNS FROM foo WHERE modeltype = 'numerical'
- Automatic tests for schema upgrades.
- dha NAME column with codebook without models is all borked up.

* Language issues

** Major design changes

- Split `btable' into `table' and `generator'.
- Generator schemas: CREATE GENERATOR t_cc FOR t USING crosscat(...)
- Make `COLUMNS OF generator' a first-class table in BQL.
- SELECT t.(ESTIMATE COLUMNS ...)
- Reject metamodel-specific functions in SELECT; use ESTIMATE instead.
- Provide a way to name models.

** Minor tweaks

- Common table expressions (WITH t AS (SELECT ...); SELECT ...).
  (Requires upgrading sqlite3 past what's in Ubuntu 14.04.)
- Implement INFER to DTRT with imputing for predictive probability.
- Implement SIMULATE as a virtual table.
- Support renaming columns.

* Shell

- Background analysis in the bayeslite shell.
- Allow multiline queries/expressions in .sql/.python shell commands.
- Allow statements and expressions alike in .python command.
- Figure out how to write transactions command by command in shell.

** Plotting

- Get plotting in the bayeslite shell working in Ubuntu 14.04.
- Plotting on Mac OS X is all borked up.
- Plotting on Ubuntu 14.04 is all borked up.
