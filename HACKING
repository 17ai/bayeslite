Every commit on long-term branches including master should pass

% ./check.sh

which builds bayeslite and runs the automatic tests.  Please run this
in your .git/hooks/pre-commit script during development, and in each
commit please add or update automatic tests for any bugs you add or
features you fix in the that commit.

check.sh does a clean build of bayeslite into the build/ directory and
then either runs `py.test tests shell', if you pass it no arguments;
or runs py.test with the arguments supplied.

Thus, if you're hacking a limited part of bayeslite, you can, e.g.,
run a subset of tests, and stop at the first failure, with

   % ./check.sh -x tests/test_frobnitz.py

However, please double-check that every commit you have made passes
all tests before publishing the commits.
