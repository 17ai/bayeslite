Every commit on long-term branches including master should pass

% ./check.sh

which builds bayeslite and runs the automatic tests.  Please run this
in your .git/hooks/pre-commit script during development, and in each
commit please add or update automatic tests for any bugs you add or
features you fix in the that commit.

check.sh enters the test/ directory and passes its arguments to
py.test.  Thus, if you're hacking a limited part of bayeslite, you can
run a subset of the tests by naming the test_*.py files to run on the
check.sh command line in .git/hooks/pre-commit.  However, please
double-check that every commit you have made passes all tests before
publishing the commits.
